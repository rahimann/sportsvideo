Brest vs AJ Auxerre

Brest, in search of Europe, hosts a struggling Auxerre team this Friday. A crucial duel for both clubs in Ligue 1.

Brest welcomes Auxerre this Friday at the Stade Francis-Le BlÃ© for a crucial duel in Ligue 1. Still looking for a first success in 2025, AJA will have to surpass itself against a Brest team who are solid on the national scene despite a recent European disappointment.

Brest, between European ambitions and accumulated fatigue
Exhausted by a busy schedule, Brest suffered a heavy defeat (0-3) against PSG in the Champions League on Tuesday. But in Ligue 1, Ã‰ric Roy's team has shown impressive consistency with four wins in its last five games. Currently eighth, the Pirates are aiming for a return to Europe, finding themselves just two points behind sixth-placed Lyon. At home, Brest has been formidable with three wins in its last four home games in the league, scoring nine goals and conceding three. A defeat against Auxerre would nevertheless mark a first series of consecutive defeats at Francis-Le BlÃ© since March 2023.

Auxerre, a dynamic that urgently needs to be reversed
For Christophe Pelissier, the weeks go by and the victories are slow in coming. Auxerre have gone ten games without a win in all competitions and have only taken three points in six Ligue 1 games this year. AJA are particularly struggling away from home with four consecutive defeats and 11 goals conceded over this period. Symbolising their difficulties, the Burgundy club let two leads slip in the second half against Toulouse (2-2) during their last outing. However, Auxerre can rely on their convincing success against Brest in September (3-0) to hope for a comeback. A victory on Friday would be historic, allowing AJA to string together two consecutive wins against Brest for the first time in Ligue 1.

This match promises to be decisive for two teams with opposing trajectories: Brest, ambitious and solid at home, facing an Auxerre team looking for a new lease of life to escape the red zone.
